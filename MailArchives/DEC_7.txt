Here are some plugins which you should have a look at:
maven-compiler-plugin ( compilerId )
maven-release-plugin ( mavenExecutorId )

Now you need to do some Plexus-stuff, since that's the DI-framework for  
Maven.
Every task-implementation needs to have the same interface (plexus role)  
and a specific id (role-hint)
In your manager you can let Plexus fill a map based on the plexus role.
So now you can add a parameter to your plugin with a default taskId, and  
users can overrule it.
I think this meets your requirements.

Good luck,

Robert
