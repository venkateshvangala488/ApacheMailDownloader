Hi, 

I don't understand your problem and doubt many people do. What is validation.xml and how does
it relate to validation-global.xml? Why is form-validation tag relevant? I am afraid your
question is as cryptic as Napoleon's kremlin letter (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20572136).
If you succinctly describe how your problem can be reproduced by any mailing list subscriber,
there is a better chance you get a helpful reply. 


Kind regards, 
Mikhail Kalkov

Do you set any encoding in your pom.xml? 

for example see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/encoding.html

Hi 
I am building my project using maven, 
I have some german character in my validation-global.xml 
When I build it they got converted to some garbage value in validation.xml. 

If I add <? Xml version=1.0 encoding =”iso-8859-1”> in validation-global.xml , then
after build german character placed as it is in validation.xml. 
But in validation.xml after <form-validation> I have again <? Xml version=1.0 encoding
=”iso-8859-1”> which violets the XML structure and it doesnot work. 

Please assist
