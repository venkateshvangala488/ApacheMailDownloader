I've never used XDoclet but it sounds like xmlencoding attribute of < strutsvalidationxml/
> tag only sets the output encoding, and there is no simple way to set the input incoding.
It is also noteworthy that the default output encoding is UTF-8. Can you try to convert your
validator-global.xml from iso-8859-1 to utf-8? Which version of xdoclet and xdoclet-maven-plugin
do you use by the way?

When we include xdoclet in the project there is no need to write validation.xml (for struts
validation). 
All rules are defined in validator-global.xml and when user build using maven validation.xml
is generated runtime and validator-global.xml is merged in validation.xml 
All properties are defined in <strutsvalidationxml/> 
http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/xdoclet/ant/xdoclet/modules/apache/struts/StrutsValidationXmlSubTask.html


if I write some german character in the validator-global.xml , and when build all german character
are converted to some garbage value in validation.xml. 

hope this is will clear the problem.

Hi, 

I don't understand your problem and doubt many people do. What is validation.xml and how does
it relate to validation-global.xml? Why is form-validation tag relevant? I am afraid your
question is as cryptic as Napoleon's kremlin letter (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20572136).
If you succinctly describe how your problem can be reproduced by any mailing list subscriber,
there is a better chance you get a helpful reply. 


Kind regards, 
Mikhail Kalkov

Do you set any encoding in your pom.xml? 

for example see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/encoding.html

If I add <? Xml version=1.0 encoding =”iso-8859-1”> in validation-global.xml , then
after build german character placed as it is in validation.xml. 
But in validation.xml after <form-validation> I have again <? Xml version=1.0 encoding
=”iso-8859-1”> which violets the XML structure and it doesnot work. 

Please assist
